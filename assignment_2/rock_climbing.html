    <title>Most web pages on bouldering are very basic with a white paground and an image with some text.
        I tried to add a little flare but I didn't know what else to do.

        <h2>The basics</h2>
            <p>indoor rock climbing is like climbing outdoors but better. You never have to worry about the 
                rain, snow, the temperature outside, all you have to worry about the how much time you want to 
                spend there. Indoor rock climbing is an inexpesive way to workout, relive stress, and meet some 
                aweseome new people as you tackle routs together!
            </p>
        <h2>What to Wear</h2>
            <p> The only thing you need to climb are shoes. You dont need specialized clithing tailor made for
                clibming to get started. In fact, alot of the time people will wear their work clohtes since they
                want to work out before going home from work. They just always keep thier shoes in their car so they can go
                whenever they like. But do keep in mind that the shoe needs to be a sung fit on your feet and in general is
                about two or three times sizes smaller than what you normally wear.
